ScraQuiz
========

The goal of this project is to learn Elm and practice writing software.  I have some relatives who are very strong Scrabble players.  It has become clear that I am never going to beat them without a bit of training.  This little app provides a quiz over seven important wordlists (twos, threes, consonants only, consonants only (with Y), words with Q, words with Q but no U, words with 2 or more among JXQZ).  Each quiz contains words drawn from one of the lists possibly with some letters altered.  The user must select the valid Scrabble words.  As the user plays multiple rounds, the app tracks the hits and misses and increases the frequency with which the misses show up.

If you happen to look at the code, I am very happy to learn of ways I can improve it.  Also, if you find any errors in the word lists, do let me know!
